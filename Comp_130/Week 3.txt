Plan -> Do -> Test -> Review
The difference between games design and technical design/implementation

Plan - making sure what is more important to see in a game (more fun).
Do - generally, this is all about actually implementing features.
Test - It makes a olt of sense to have designers driving test:
	* Designers are the effective customers for the systems programmers have implemented.
	* Programmers are terrible at testing their code.
	* This is answering the 'does it work' question.
Review - It makes a lot of sense to have designers driving this stage:
	* Designers will have a better idea of overall 'big picture' of the game.
	* This is answering 'is it fun' question.
	* Programmers also need to answer the 'does it work' question.

Single Responsiblity principle

Creative Controller!! (Alt-Controller)

Contructor is placed after starting public block.
There can be multiple constructors.
The contructor must be the same name as the class.
It only holds a parameters of that class.

Deconstructor is called when the deleting this constructor to save memory.
~[name](){};

Any parameters/stats are called in private block.
But giving any variables should be in public block.

Don't put too much into classes
Separate different funcitons into different classes.
